                <p>Hi guys

It's Thursday today. Everyday is Thursday. How could it not be Thursday today if everyday weren't Thursday? After all, if everyday wasn't Thursday, then there would be a good chance that it wouldn't be Thursday when you read this. But I said that today is Thursday. I know this because there are seven Thursdays. And all of them are every day because all of them are Thursday. You may be thinking, "This guy is an idiot. There are other days". If you voice those thoughts out loud, then I will ban you instantly, because you clearly are a bigot.

Anyways, happy Thursday. </p>
