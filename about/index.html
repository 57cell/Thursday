    <h3 style="text-align:center;">What is the Thursday Council?</h3>

    <p>The Thursday Council is a non-profit organization founded solely to spread our ideology. We believe in one simple thing: every day is Thursday. No exceptions.</p>

    <p>Society has favored a system of seven unique days of the week for thousands of years. But we believe that this system is completely outdated and inefficient in our modern civilization. It is simply no longer relevant in contemporary culture.</p>

    <p>Thus, we have devised a revolutionary system that is significantly better in virtually every way. Here's how it works:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Monday has been renamed to Thursday 1</li>
        <li>Tuesday has been renamed to Thursday 2</li>
        <li>Wednesday has been renamed to Thursday 3</li>
        <li>Thursday has been renamed to Thursday 4</li>
        <li>Friday has been renamed to Thursday 5</li>
        <li>Saturday has been renamed to Thursday 6</li>
        <li>Sunday has been renamed to Thursday 7</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Although we continue to adhere to traditional seven day weeks and continue to use the same months as everyone else, we have completely reworked the fundamental building blocks of the calendar year: the days.</p>

    <p>The Thursday Council, therefore, is the facilitator of the transition from the old week to the new one. Who are we? We are the catalyst of change and the harbingers of truth. We help share the news and further the evolution of the human race, which has finally begun the adoption of an objectively superior week. After all, changing the names of the days is no easy feat, and our accomplishment of this task is one deserving of eternal celebration, hence our selling of official Thursday merchandise and perpetually positive attitude.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center;">So, Good Morning, and Happy Thursday!</p>

        <h3 style="text-align:center;">What is the Dogma?</h3>
            <p>The Thursday Council and its members must adhere to a strong moral code. Five doctrines, each designed to promote our vision: a society devoid not only of days other than Thursday, but one profoundly influenced by philosophies which genuinely benefit the people.</p>
            <p>Thursday Council members who violate the Dogma risk having their membership suspended. It is of utmost importance that we maintain the Dogma to avoid compromising our legitamacy.</p>

            <label for="q1">Why Thursday?</label>
            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>This is a complicated question, but in summary, it has to do with our history as an organization and our founding principles. Our ways are primarily derived from Rögnvaldur Valtýsson's philosophies. Valtýsson, born April 3, 1913, was an Icelandic philosopher, post-postmodernist, and psychologist who effectively revolutionized absurdism but remains widely unknown. His theories were very controversial during life and forgotten after death. Recent rediscovery of his theories led to the founding of the Thursday Council, an organization inspired by his thought experiment known as 'Þursarismi', or roughly 'Thursdarianism'.</p>

              <p>The Thursday Council does not identify as a cult or religion. We hesitate to call ourselves a community, much less a cult. We are united under our beliefs, but have no malicious intent and would rather not be associated with the idea of cults.</p>

            <label for="q5">Why does Thursday 1 coincide with 'Monday' rather than what others regularly call Thursday (Thursday 4)?</label>
            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>This is purely coincidental and does not, should not matter. This question is derived from a fundamental misunderstanding of the days of the week. As all days have always been Thursday, there is no one Thursday that is objectively more Thursday just because users of the common seven day week happen to agree with us that that day is Thursday. Just as they arbitrarily assigned 'Monday' or 'Sunday' to be the starting point of their week for convenience, we have done the same. We picked an arbitrary 1/7 sector of the week and designated it as the first Thursday, and accordingly numbered the following days to maintain logical consistency.</p>

            <label for="q8">What were Valtýsson’s philosophical teachings?</label>
            <div class="faq-content">
              <p>Þursarismi is, at its core, an amplification and deconstruction of absurdism, taking it to radical extremes. While absurdism grapples with the meaninglessness of life, Þursarismi takes a more direct approach, tackling head on this meaningless and amalgamating it into something utterly incomprehensible. Valtýsson, in his incredible genius, melded absurdism into a fractal of layered ironies, to the degree that Valtýsson had become an expert in neologics by the end of his career. This irony is not the traditional irony found in common literature, and is hardly related to the three types of irony often taught in formal education. Like a Matryoshka doll, each statement of Valtýsson’s was obfuscated by countless layers of intentionally confusing irony, with each one housing smaller, equally intricate sub-layers that are themselves laced with contradictions and opposing interpretations.
    In addition to radicalizing absurdism to the point where it was something new entirely, Þursarismi intersects with post-postmodernism by incorporating endless cycles of self-reference and self-critique. Where postmodernism is skeptical of grand narratives and ideologies, post-postmodernism explores what might be gained or reconstructed in their wake. Valtýsson established that the very tools used to deconstruct can also be used to build, but what is built is always teetering on the edge of becoming a paradox or an absurdity.
    The philosophy is also intertwined with metamodernism, balancing itself between sincerity and irony. Yet in this case, sincerity and irony are not simply oscillating; they are superimposed upon each other to create a state of "sincere irony" or "ironic sincerity," each manifesting as a contortion of the other. The result is a form of discourse that is paradoxically genuine and fake, authentic and simulated, in the same breath. Valtýsson labeled this phenomenon as "metairony."
    But Valtýsson's Þursarismi doesn't stop there. It also contributes to existentialism with its own idiosyncratic takes. Valtýsson argued that the act of questioning the meaning of life is not merely a mental exercise but a form of existential choreography—a dance between the angst of non-meaning and the ecstasy of potential meaning. He coined the term “Efnistilvistarballett”, or “Existential Ballet”, to encapsulate this idea, adding a performative and aesthetic dimension to existential discourse.
    In Þursarismi, life is not a problem to be solved but an endless parade of enigmas to be marvelously and horrifically puzzled by. One does not resolve these enigmas but revels in their irresolvability, allowing them to proliferate, mutate, and eventually self-destruct in a spectacular burst of irony and meaninglessness. It is not just a philosophy; it's an incendiary, exhilarating explosion of thought that attempts to laugh in the face of the void while acknowledging that the void is laughing right back.</p>
