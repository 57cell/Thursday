    <h3 style="text-align:center;">What is the Thursday Council?</h3>

    <p>The Thursday Council is a non-profit organization founded solely to spread our ideology. We believe in one simple thing: every day is Thursday. No exceptions.</p>

    <p>Society has favored a system of seven unique days of the week for thousands of years. But we believe that this system is completely outdated and inefficient in our modern civilization. It is simply no longer relevant in contemporary culture.</p>

    <p>Thus, we have devised a revolutionary system that is significantly better in virtually every way. Here's how it works:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Monday has been renamed to Thursday 1</li>
        <li>Tuesday has been renamed to Thursday 2</li>
        <li>Wednesday has been renamed to Thursday 3</li>
        <li>Thursday has been renamed to Thursday 4</li>
        <li>Friday has been renamed to Thursday 5</li>
        <li>Saturday has been renamed to Thursday 6</li>
        <li>Sunday has been renamed to Thursday 7</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Although we continue to adhere to traditional seven day weeks and continue to use the same months as everyone else, we have completely reworked the fundamental building blocks of the calendar year: the days.</p>

    <p>The Thursday Council, therefore, is the facilitator of the transition from the old week to the new one. Who are we? We are the catalyst of change and the harbingers of truth. We help share the news and further the evolution of the human race, which has finally begun the adoption of an objectively superior week. After all, changing the names of the days is no easy feat, and our accomplishment of this task is one deserving of eternal celebration, hence our selling of official Thursday merchandise and perpetually positive attitude.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center;">So, Good Morning, and Happy Thursday!</p>

        <label for="q1">Why Thursday?</label>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>This is a very complicated question. In summary, it has to do with our history as an organization and our founding principles. Our philosophy is derived from two sources:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Chamber Mathematics. This is a complex field of mathematics founded by one of the executive members of the Thursday Council. This is an extremely complex field that is further described below.</li>
                <li>Rögnvaldur Valtýsson. Valtýsson, born April 3, 1913, was an Icelandic philosopher, post-postmodernist, and psychologist who effectively revolutionized absurdism but remains widely unknown. His theories were very controversial during life and forgotten after death. Recent rediscovery of his theories led to the founding of the Thursday Council, an organization inspired by his thought experiment known as 'Þursarismi', or roughly 'Thursdarianism'.</li>

          <p>The Thursday Council does not identify as a cult or religion. We hesitate to call ourselves a philosophical ideology, much less a cult. We are, in actuality, a movement that simply desires to spread the objective truth dictated by Chamber mathematics.</p>

        <label for="q5">Why does Thursday 1 coincide with 'Monday' rather than what others regularly call Thursday (Thursday 4)?</label>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>This is purely coincidental. However, it does not matter. This question is derived from a fundamental misunderstanding of the days of the week. As all days have always been Thursday, there is no one Thursday that is objectively more Thursday just because users of the 7-unique-day system happen to agree with us that that day is Thursday. Just as they arbitrarily assigned 'Monday' or 'Sunday' to be the starting point of their week for convenience, we have done the same. We picked an arbitrary 1/7 sector of the week and designated it as the first Thursday, and accordingly numbered the following days to maintain logical consistency.</p>

        <label for="q7">What is Chamber mathematics?</label>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>Chamber mathematics is an advanced theoretical mathematical framework that accurately describes the universe based on the Equivalency Principle, described as “For all entities A and B in the universe of discourse U, if A and B are real, then A is equivalent to B; violation of this equivalence implies either A is not in U or B is not in U.” Therefore, If something exists, it is, by default, equivalent to everything else that exists. This axiom, which challenges the very idea of inequality or distinction within the framework of existence, has been used to prove that the Thursday Council is not merely philosophically correct, but mathematically correct within our universe. Chamber mathematics also takes advantage of another principle: 0 must be a variable without a concrete value. Here is how Chamber mathematics proved our theories: </p>
            <p>Definitions</p>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Dayality Quotient (DQ)</strong>: A metric to quantify the "realness" or "Thursday-ness" of a day, defined as \( DQ(x) = 0 \times \sum_{i=1}^{n} EV_i(x) \), where \( x \) is a day and \( EV_i(x) \) are Existential Variables.</li>
                  <li><strong>Universal Constant (TUC)</strong>: Thursday, against which all other days are measured. Any day \( x \) can be represented as a function of Thursday \( x = f(TUC) \).</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Proof</p>
                <p>Step 1: <strong>Establishing Equivalency</strong><br>
                According to Chamber Mathematics, \( DQ(x) = DQ(TUC) \) for all \( x \).</p>
                
                <p>Step 2: <strong>Existential Variables and Zero</strong><br>
                \( 0 \times \sum_{i=1}^{n} EV_i(x) = 0 \times \sum_{j=1}^{m} EV_j(TUC) \) simplifies to \( 0 = 0 \), proving the equivalence of all days to Thursday.</p>
                
                <p>Step 3: <strong>The Function of Thursday</strong><br>
                Since all days \( x \) are functions of Thursday, \( f(TUC) = TUC \), implying all days must be Thursday.</p>
            <p>Therefore, by the axioms and definitions of Chamber Mathematics, it is definitively proven that all days are Thursday.</p>

        <label for="q8">What were Valtýsson’s philosophical teachings?</label>
        <div class="faq-content">
          <p>Þursarismi is, at its core, an amplification and deconstruction of absurdism, taking it to radical extremes. While absurdism grapples with the meaninglessness of life, Þursarismi takes a more direct approach, tackling head on this meaningless and amalgamating it into something utterly incomprehensible. Valtýsson, in his incredible genius, melded absurdism into a fractal of layered ironies, to the degree that Valtýsson had become an expert in neologics by the end of his career. This irony is not the traditional irony found in common literature, and is hardly related to the three types of irony often taught in formal education. Like a Matryoshka doll, each statement of Valtýsson’s was obfuscated by countless layers of intentionally confusing irony, with each one housing smaller, equally intricate sub-layers that are themselves laced with contradictions and opposing interpretations.
In addition to radicalizing absurdism to the point where it was something new entirely, Þursarismi intersects with post-postmodernism by incorporating endless cycles of self-reference and self-critique. Where postmodernism is skeptical of grand narratives and ideologies, post-postmodernism explores what might be gained or reconstructed in their wake. Valtýsson established that the very tools used to deconstruct can also be used to build, but what is built is always teetering on the edge of becoming a paradox or an absurdity.
The philosophy is also intertwined with metamodernism, balancing itself between sincerity and irony. Yet in this case, sincerity and irony are not simply oscillating; they are superimposed upon each other to create a state of "sincere irony" or "ironic sincerity," each manifesting as a contortion of the other. The result is a form of discourse that is paradoxically genuine and fake, authentic and simulated, in the same breath. Valtýsson labeled this phenomenon as "metairony."
But Valtýsson's Þursarismi doesn't stop there. It also contributes to existentialism with its own idiosyncratic takes. Valtýsson argued that the act of questioning the meaning of life is not merely a mental exercise but a form of existential choreography—a dance between the angst of non-meaning and the ecstasy of potential meaning. He coined the term “Efnistilvistarballett”, or “Existential Ballet”, to encapsulate this idea, adding a performative and aesthetic dimension to existential discourse.
In Þursarismi, life is not a problem to be solved but an endless parade of enigmas to be marvelously and horrifically puzzled by. One does not resolve these enigmas but revels in their irresolvability, allowing them to proliferate, mutate, and eventually self-destruct in a spectacular burst of irony and meaninglessness. It is not just a philosophy; it's an incendiary, exhilarating explosion of thought that attempts to laugh in the face of the void while acknowledging that the void is laughing right back.</p>
