      <p>Recently, an article was published by the Frederick Lantern, acknowledging the Thursday Council. Thank you for doing this! We truly love knowing that some people outside the Council are willing to attempt to understand who we are, and make that analysis public information via an article.</p>
      <p>However, your article is not without concerns. Thus, we find it necessary to fully respond to your article, because there are some misconceptions in it which we believe falsely depict who we are. Per your own Editorial Policy, the article may fall under that "libelous, defamatory, or untrue" category if further evidence and justification for your claims are not provided.</p>
      <p>But don't worry! It's nothing big, and we don't actually care that much. But we would still like you to publish a follow up article in which you conduct proper journalistic investigation, preferrably an interview.</p>
      <p>Our main concern with your current statements about us is that you assume we are joking, and you assume so with complete confidence. Let me be more specific.</p>
