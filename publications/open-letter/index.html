      <p>Recently, an article was published by the Frederick Lantern, acknowledging the Thursday Council. So, dear FHS: thank you for doing this! We truly love knowing that some people outside the Council are willing to attempt to understand who we are, and make that analysis public information via an article.</p>
      <p>However, your article is not without concerns. Thus, we find it necessary to fully respond to your article, because there are some misconceptions in it which we believe falsely depict who we are. Per your own Editorial Policy, the article may fall under that “libelous, defamatory, or untrue” category if further evidence and justification for your claims are not provided.</p>
      <p>But don&#39;t worry! It&#39;s nothing big, and we don&#39;t actually care that much. But we would still like you to publish a follow-up article in which you conduct proper investigative journalism, preferably an interview. Our main concern with your current statements about us is that you assume we are joking, and you assume so with complete confidence. It&#39;s important to be specific, so I&#39;ll go paragraph by paragraph and break down your article.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Last week, black and white fliers were pinned up on bulletin boards in the hallways. The fliers had an odd-shaped black blob in the middle and a white hand-drawn smiley face. The text wishes the passerby a “Happy Thursday” and is signed “The Thursday Council.” In the bottom left corner are a website and an email address, but there are no names anywhere. No one—including admin—seems to know who put this flyer up or what it’s about.</p>
      <p>So what is the Thursday Council?</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This is a wonderful opener! I love this bit so much. Fun fact about those posters--they&#39;re actually supposed to be a lot more visually appealing. <a href="https://files.catbox.moe/8f7yma.TIF">Here&#39;s what they were supposed to look like</a>. We ended up making them without any color mostly because it was a lot easier to print those in bulk.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>According to their website, the Thursday Council is an organization (they do “not identify as a cult or religion” and “hesitate to call ourselves a community”) founded to spread their ideology… that every day should be Thursday. No exceptions. The Thursday Council believes that the system of having seven different days of the week is outdated and inefficient, claiming it is simply no longer relevant to our culture anymore. According to the Thursday Council, what we know as Monday is Thursday 1, Tuesday is Thursday 2, Wednesday is Thursday 3, and so on.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Again, this is a great paragraph. Very apt summary of our about page. No complaints here.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Why Thursday? The idea is based on the philosophies of Rögnvaldur Valtysson, an Icelandic philosopher, post-postmodernist, and psychologist who revolutionized absurdism. Absurdism is the philosophy that the universe is random, life is meaningless, and the best way to be one with the universe is to rebel against order. According to the Thursday Council:</p>
      <p>“Valtýsson’s philosophy is at its core, an amplification and deconstruction of absurdism, taking it to a degree of extremism.  [ . . . ] Only a sliver of the ideas Valtýsson mocked have been passed down into the modern era, and the Thursday Council’s shard was that element of absurdism. We have since compressed and simplified it into an essence so simple that anyone could understand—every day is Thursday.”</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>I appreciate that the time was taken to fully read and understand our little section about Valtýsson. Understandably, most people don’t do this, since it’s a long and dull read (one which is largely a summary in itself). Again, you’ve summed it up quite nicely!</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>According to the Thursday Council, the rediscovery of his theories led to the founding of the Thursday Council, as they were inspired by his thought experiment known as “Thursdarianism.” The only trouble with this is that Rögnvaldur Valtysson doesn’t seem to exist.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Yes, this is true. The Thursday Council derives most of its philosophies from Thursdarianism. We generally prefer to use the word Þursarismi (pronounced like “thursa-riss-me”), as the English translation is very rough. The Icelandic word alone carries pretty significant meaning. Now, here’s where we must get a little critical of your article: you claim that Valtýsson doesn’t seem to exist. I assume this conclusion was drawn when an internet search yielded no satisfying results. Admittedly, he does indeed have no internet presence, as the vast majority of information regarding him is currently unpublished, and that which is public is mostly falsely attributed to other Absurdist philosophers. This is because one executive member of the Thursday Council possesses sole ownership of all primary sources pertaining to Valtýsson, including books, personal writings, and all records of his existence. Not only do most members of the Thursday Council not have access to the original copies, the sole owner has decided to keep it all private indefinitely.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>So is this all a joke? Yes, and that’s the point: whoever developed The Thursday Council is someone who enjoys the philosophy of absurdity and is using it to point out the absurdity in our own lives. Just as everyone accepts that Monday or Sunday is the starting point of the week, The Thursday Council has done the same with Thursdays. They picked an “arbitrary 1/7 sector” of the week and designated it as the first Thursday and numbered the following days in the same way that someone long ago arbitrarily picked a day and called it Monday.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This is not correct. Our use of absurdism does to equate to our ideology being satire—the former is true, but the latter could not be more wrong. First, do you know what a joke is? Because we don’t. I, the author of this open letter and a representative of the Thursday Council, could not tell you what makes something a joke unless it is intentionally obvious. At what point does a joke become serious, and how can we distinguish playful and humorous satire from serious ideology when the ideology in question concerns metaironic philosophy? In this case, we are genuine in everything we claim to believe. We want every day to be Thursday, advocate for the personal standards set by our Dogma, and are not joking. Besides, even if we were, how would you definitively know?</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>This absurdity is found in everything The Thursday Council has put out. Its members must follow a strong moral code called the Dogma. Thursday Council members who violate the Dogma will risk having their membership suspended despite the group having no meetings and no hierarchy. The Thursday Council has four other doctrines to promote its vision: universal happiness, justice, acceptance of others, and self-acceptance. And of course, a calendar full of Thursdays.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Yes, we have implemented some degree of absurdism into nearly everything we have done. But do not conflate the philosophy of absurdism with absurd as it is commonly used in a non-philosophy context. The Dogma is serious, and suspension as a consequence of violation generally means that we will, as an organization, cease association. This could be as trivial as a kick or ban from our Discord server, if applicable; because yes, our current lack of real world consequences doesn’t mean much more than that. We are still a new and growing organization, and there is no amount of wrongdoing which, in our eyes, justifies anything else.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>The Thursday Council says on its website that it is not currently affiliated with any other organizations or movements and has a place to buy merchandise (they collect no profit from sales — a payment only covers the cost of manufacturing, shipping, and sales tax). This proves that The Thursday Council is not a grift or a scam or a trojan horse to some other political movement… it’s just a joke.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>How did you come to the conclusion that we are a joke based on our selling of merchandise and lack of affiliation with other organizations? Those are unrelated things. Of course, you are correct in that we are not a grift, scam, or trojan horse either (these would be equally strange conclusions to come to). Our merchandise store is through Printify, a reputable on-demand print service. Granted, we have had only one order: a $79 purchase made by a student at Mead, but we are still legitimate regardless.</p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>So who put up the posters and spread this joke? It’s unclear. It could be a Frederick student or staff member behind the whole thing, or maybe someone stumbled across the group online. Yet in the spirit of absurdism, it doesn’t really matter either. Whoever it is seems to have just wanted to give Frederick a laugh and poke fun at all the order and schedules we believe control our lives. If you want in on the joke, you can join The Thursday Council on their website or contact them at cardinal@thursdaycouncil.org. They also have an Instagram (started on August 28) and a Discord server where you can talk with other members.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>You’re still wrong, but that’s the spirit! We’re all just here to have fun and live good lives, so nothing matters all too much anyway. To address your other statements: </p>
      <ul>
      <li>We are not a single individual. The Thursday Council truly is composed of a multitude of people. Whether we are students or staff is irrelevant.</li>
      <li>I do like your idea that we might be poking fun at those schedules which control our lives. You are correct in that, but that is not an intention of the Thursday Council. It&#39;s a nice interpretation though, if you&#39;re unwilling to adapt to our ways.</li>
      <li>Thank you for pointing out our contact info! However, we prefer that people join the Council via the form on our website. It&#39;s a little buggy, and it might not look like it submits right, but we get it on our end.</li>
      <li>Yes, we have an Instagram, thanks to our social media manager and executive member John Alzheimer! We are currently working on getting it more active and perhaps getting more social media accounts in general. And of course, our Discord really is the only place to directly interact with some other members, since we&#39;re spread out across four schools.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Again, thanks for the article! Two members in particular explicitly told me they’d potentially be interested in getting interviewed by the Frederick Lantern, so if you feel that would be good, then please reach out to either of them at <a href="mailto:delta@thursdaycouncil.org">delta@thursdaycouncil.org</a> or <a href="mailto:john.j.alzheimers@thursdaycouncil.org">john.j.alzheimers@thursdaycouncil.org</a>.</p>
      <p>Happy Thursday!</p>
