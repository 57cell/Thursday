      <p><span class="c13"></span></p>
      <p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c10">Wobbly Life is a video game developed by a small indie game development studio called &quot;RubberBandGames.&quot; </span><span class="c2">In Wobbly Life, players enter a colorful and whimsical open world where they take on the role of customizable characters that are intentionally designed to have a comical, wobbly appearance. The game focuses on fun and lighthearted activities, often involving cooperative or multiplayer gameplay. Players can engage in various activities such as mini-games, exploring the world, driving vehicles, completing challenges, and interacting with other players in a sandbox-style environment.</span></p>
      <p><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first glance, this game looks like just a simple kids game, the premise is very simple. You are kicked out of your house because you don&rsquo;t make any money. So you have to complete jobs to raise money to buy a house. People could argue that this is a great kids game, because it teaches kids responsibility and how to get a job.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 200.51px; height: 200.51px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.jpg" style="width: 200.51px; height: 200.51px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
      <p><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except, this game has a dark secret behind it. There is something much more serious about this game, and we will take an in depth look at it. But first we have to take a look at some history.</span></p>
      <p><span class="c10">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1775, the battle of Lexington and Concord took place. The British army, (Wobbly Life takes place in Britain) invaded the thirteen colonies, </span><span class="c2">intending to suppress the possibility of rebellion by seizing weapons from the colonists. The colonists were prepared for this, they put up a great fight against the British army. Britain was embarrassed by the untrained colonists volunteer soldiers. Later, the Battle of Bunker Hill happened, and it took the British four attempts to overpower the colonists, which again embarrassed the British Army.</span></p>
      <p><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The British were so angry at America for embarrassing them, that they have been planning their revenge since then. Unfortunately, it looks like their revenge is near. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the game there is Anti-American propaganda everywhere, this is a photo from the actual video game.</span></p>
      <p><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 262.50px; height: 198.26px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.jpg" style="width: 262.50px; height: 198.26px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
      <p><span class="c2">As you can see, the creators of this game have very strong opinions about America, except why would a small indie company have such strong vocal opinions about this in a kids game? Well obviously, an indie company is a fake front, for what actually is the whole government working on this game. The whole British government put some effort into making this game, but that leads to the next question, why is the government putting effort into making a game about their plans, especially a kid&#39;s game?</span></p>
      <p><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my opinion, I think that this was supposed to be a warning to the Americans, but they revealed too much. I mean, it&rsquo;s so blatantly obvious. I have four reasons.</span></p>
      <p><span class="c9"></span></p>
      <p><span class="c9">Reason 1</span></p>
      <p><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the game, you have the option to fly over to the mountains of &ldquo;Wobbly Islands,&rdquo; at first glance these mountains seem relatively useless, being all you can get from them is a plane, or a car. But if you go behind the mountain, there is a secret elevator. This elevator takes you into a cave in the mountains, the cave has a series of tunnels that you can slide around in. Again, it just seems like a simple gimmick for kids, but they mean much more.</span></p>
      <p><span class="c2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After going through the first set of tunnels, you can reach a secret passageway, but it is covered by snow and debris. It is seemingly impossible to get through, but with a glitch, you can make it through. This tunnel walks around under all of &ldquo;Wobbly Island&rdquo; which is the name of the fictional island this game takes place in. </span></p>
      <p><span class="c2">This tunnel is filled with devices such as bombs, dynamite, nuclear waste, etc. Which could only mean one thing. Britain has been digging out tunnel&rsquo;s under the ocean to America, this is how they are going to transport materials, and how they plan to sneak attack us. At the end of the tunnel there is a room which seems to have layouts of different places in &ldquo;Wobbly Island.&rdquo; Which obviously means they are planning certain areas in America for attack.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 256.50px; height: 192.38px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.jpg" style="width: 256.50px; height: 192.38px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 250.62px; height: 187.77px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.jpg" style="width: 250.62px; height: 187.77px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
      <p><span class="c2"></span></p>
      <p><span class="c2"></span></p>
      <p><span class="c9">Reason 2</span></p>
      <p><span class="c2">One of Wobbly Life&rsquo;s main selling points is that you can raise money to buy pets. The pets in Wobbly Life can do many things, like work for you. The pets include things such as snakes, dogs, cats, etc. But there is one pet that stands out from the rest. That &ldquo;pet&rdquo; is a gnome. This pet is very disturbing, because of how much it looks like a real person. And the fact that you can make the &ldquo;pets&rdquo; do anything, it is basically slavery.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 283.42px; height: 212.81px;"><img alt="" src="images/image1.jpg" style="width: 283.42px; height: 212.81px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
      <p><span class="c2">Britain is going to use the leftover survivors of their attacks as slaves. They had played such a big role in the Slave Trade, and now they plan on bringing back slavery. Which is bad. This also explains how the British sees us as little people, or gnomes. They don&rsquo;t think highly of us, and now they plan on turning us into slaves.</span></p>
      <p><span class="c2"></span></p>
      <p><span class="c2"></span></p>
      <p><span class="c9">Reason 3</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 186.23px; height: 139.49px;"><img alt="" src="images/image8.jpg" style="width: 186.23px; height: 139.49px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
      <p><span class="c2">A landmark in Wobbly Life is the power plant, or nuclear power plant. There is a job here in which you smuggle nuclear waste into an unknown area, or dispose of it illegally. This shows how Britain is planning use of nuclear weapons, or bombs in the America&rsquo;s. This ties back to the tunnel.</span></p>
      <p><span class="c2"></span></p>
      <p><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 218.50px; height: 162.88px;"><img alt="" src="images/image9.jpg" style="width: 218.50px; height: 162.88px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
      <p><span class="c9">Why would they make this into a game?</span></p>
      <p><span class="c2">It is also important to mention that there is a temple in this game, which has hieroglyphic images all throughout the temple, and taking a closer look at them, they all tie into the three reasons above.</span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 248.01px; height: 186.01px;"><img alt="" src="images/image3.jpg" style="width: 248.01px; height: 186.01px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
      <p><span class="c2"></span></p>
      <p><span class="c2">Except, why would they even make a kid&#39;s game about this? Well, besides the warning that was previously mentioned, they would need extra money to execute all of these plans. So all the profit made from this game, went straight to these plans. <br></span><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 222.55px; height: 166.91px;"><img alt="" src="images/image6.jpg" style="width: 222.55px; height: 166.91px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p>
      <p><span class="c2">&nbsp; To conclude, Britain tried to warn us of their plan for revenge on America through the game Wobbly Life, but they revealed too much, and this article exposed all their secrets, and now we can stop them.</span></p>
