      <p>Hello fellow Thursdarians, I&#39;d like to tell you about something extremely important. The Fredrick High School theatre department is putting on the teen edition of the broadway musical &quot;A Chorus Line&quot; and you should go see it! This musical is about a group of people who are auditioning to be a part of a chorus line for a broadway musical. This schools theatre department is so excited to put on this show for you. The theatre department gets all of our funding for this years other productions from the ticket sales for this production, so it&#39;s very important that people buy tickets to support the FHS theatre department. Plus, by being there you can show support to any of your friends, classmates and fellow Thursdarians that are involved in the musical. Tickets are $15. The show opens Thursday 4, October 19th at 7pm. There are also shows on Thursday 5, October 20 at 7pm and on Thursday 6, October 21st at 2pm and 7pm. That&#39;s four shows total, so if you can make it to one of them, please do!
