 <p>Cold, covered in cobwebs, and abandoned. That&#39;s how the basement here at FHS was left. Imagine you spent 62 years crafting the perfect basement environment, (one that could be used for classrooms, storage, and mystery) and your future generations left it decrepit and decaying. Well, that&#39;s exactly how I feel; horrified and disgusted at the fact that someone could cover up such glory. You know, I had machinery down there. Trinkets, gadgets, and doo-dads for tomfoolery and mischief. Now, the likelihood is that it’s all gone. 
My partner in design, Gary Basement, helped me create these things, and you have gone and taken them all away. You covered up the only two basement entrances with concrete, leaving nothing to be found. The people of this generation have no idea this place even exists! Now isn’t that grand? You have taken my legacy away from me, and now, I plan to fix it. This article&#39;s use is to formally call upon the new generation of FHS, the students, staff, parents, and admin that are attending this school. We need your help to restore the basement to its former glory. 
As soon as you finish this article, leave whatever room you’re in, and dig. Eventually, after about 20ish feet, you’ll make it to the basement of Frederick High School. The deeper you dig, the more you’ll find. Once you access the entire basement, start cleaning it out. If you find my gadgets do not touch them. It could be horrifyingly catastrophic if you do. You will take all of Frederick back to the year 1963, and move the school to 207 N Houston St, Dallas, TX 75202, and we all know what happened in November of that year. Some of the other gadgets will make you go blind, have you forget how to walk, start having a gang of 33 blind mice follow you everywhere you go, and then that you will forget how to not see, and have your vision restored. The mice will then transform into people, who will then make you blind again. All in all, not a fun experience. </p>
