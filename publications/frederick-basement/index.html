<p>Cold, covered in cobwebs, and abandoned. That&#39;s how the basement here at FHS was left. Imagine you spent 62 years crafting the perfect basement environment, (one that could be used for classrooms, storage, and mystery) and your future generations left it decrepit and decaying. Well, that&#39;s exactly how I feel; horrified and disgusted at the fact that someone could cover up such glory. You know, I had machinery down there. Trinkets, gadgets, and doo-dads for tomfoolery and mischief. Now, the likelihood is that it‚Äôs all gone. </p>
<p>My partner in design, Gary Basement, helped me create these things, and you have gone and taken them all away. You covered up the only two basement entrances with concrete, leaving nothing to be found. The people of this generation have no idea this place even exists! Now isn‚Äôt that grand? You have taken my legacy away from me, and now, I plan to fix it. This article&#39;s use is to formally call upon the new generation of FHS, the students, staff, parents, and admin that are attending this school. We need your help to restore the basement to its former glory. </p>
<p>As soon as you finish this article, leave whatever room you‚Äôre in, and dig. Eventually, after about 20ish feet, you‚Äôll make it to the basement of Frederick High School. The deeper you dig, the more you‚Äôll find. Once you access the entire basement, start cleaning it out. If you find my gadgets do not touch them. It could be horrifyingly catastrophic if you do. You will take all of Frederick back to the year 1963, and move the school to 207 N Houston St, Dallas, TX 75202; and we all know what happened in November of that year. Some of the other gadgets will make you go blind, have you forget how to walk, start having a gang of 33 blind mice follow you everywhere you go, and then that you will forget how to not see, and have your vision restored. The mice will then transform into people, who will then make you blind again. All in all, not a fun experience. </p>
<p>Now, listen up. I know that you think that I‚Äôm joking. You‚Äôre thinking ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no way that this isn‚Äôt a joke, I mean, he used the word ‚Äòtrinkets‚Äô!‚Äù Rest assured, my trinkets are very real. So real, that your interaction with them could actually take us 84 years into the future. I cannot stress this enough, don‚Äôt touch them once you get to the basement. I mean, it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs difficult to get down there. A simple shovel will do the trick, but I would find that power tools would work better. That&#39;s right, bring power tools to school and dig into the ground. I mean, who&#39;s gonna stop you? ALike, you have free will, right? Like, what‚Äôs gonna happen if you don‚Äôt, right? Like, nothing? Or like, are you like, going to like, never see the basement, like right? </p>
<p>You‚Äôre going to wanna see this, it&#39;s a really cool basement. It‚Äôs made of concrete and stuff, and like wood or something. Listen man, I don‚Äôt know how to convince you anymore. Have you ever heard of something like this before? I am 96 years old as of 7 years ago, I do not have long left. My literal dying wish is for you guys to fix this basement. It‚Äôs like that song from Frozen where they‚Äôre like üéµsomething something something fixer upperüéµ and they‚Äôre like with those little gremlin stone things. That&#39;s what I want you guys to do, turn into those little stone gremlins and fix up my basement. If you do that, I can finally die in peace. </p>
<p>To conclude, I just want this basement to be real again. My one life goal is finally being achieved, just simply by alerting this generation. This is not only a call for help, it&#39;s a call to action. I need you to help me. 
So, Frederick High School, get to digging. </p>
