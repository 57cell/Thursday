      <p>Act 1: Scene 1</p>
      <p>The scene opens to an empty room, with [Narrator] wearing all black and a hat (maybe) sitting on a chair in the middle. Lights around [Narrator] are dimmed except for a spot of light on [Narrator] and their head is down. [Narrator] has no emotion in their face, and keeps a calm and “monotone” voice, yet not a boring one. </p>
      <p>[Narrator] looks up 
      Narrator: “The American Civil War was the bloodiest battle in American history. It was a war against our own people. The place we start in this story is Lincoln’s election and Inaugural address.</p>
      <p>Lights come up to a room with [Lincoln], [Audience Member 1] and [Audience Member 2].
      [Lincoln] is in the middle behind where [Narrator] was, [Audience Member 1] has an elephant on his chest and [Audience Member 2] has a donkey. Narrator stands and moves their chair out of the way and off stage left. Ethan comes from the lights and holds up a sign that reads, “Lincoln’s First Inaugural Address, March 4th 1861.” [Lincoln] is calm and content, [Audience Member 2] looks upset and [Audience Member 1] looks  overwhelmed with joy. </p>
      <p>Lincoln: “I am here to address the nation. This country is being torn apart from within. We cannot let this happen. I promise, that I will not take your slaves. South Carolina’s secession is causing many problems. We do not want to separate this country, seceding is not the answer. I promise under the constitution formed many years ago that I will not take your slaves. I promise t-“</p>
      <p>Audience Member 2 (Interrupting and Talking in heavy Southern Accent): “ Yeah all right, whatever”</p>
      <p>Audience Member 1: “You can’t talk like that to our new President!”</p>
      <p>Audience Member 2: “Who says? That man is a traitor!”</p>
      <p>Audience Member 1: “How so? He is going to help this nation!”</p>
      <p>Audience Member 2: “Help?! He wants to take our slaves, he wants to ruin the soul of this nation!”</p>
      <p>Audience Member 1: “You crazy southerner! Have you not heard his speech?”</p>
      <p>Audience Member 2: “He’s a traitor, I know he is! He wants to destroy our beautiful America! I bet you’re just a Republican spy! Trying to trick the members of our nation.”</p>
      <p>Audience Member 1 (Angrily): “You really think that!”</p>
      <p>Audience Member 1 stands up and towers over Audience Member 2, winding back a punch</p>
      <p>Lincoln: “Ahem”
      The Audience Members Pause and look at Lincoln </p>
      <p>Lincoln: “As I was saying, this nation needs proper mending. I am the one who is in charge of doing that because of my election. This nation-</p>
      <p>All the people on stage pause, frozen in place. Lincoln&#39;s mouth is wide open, Audience Member one is still over Audience Member 2. Narrator comes out from stage left, </p>
      <p>Narrator: “I won’t bore you with his whole speech. Just know that it didn’t really do much in stopping the nation from splitting. Lincoln didn’t know it then, but in just over a month the first battle would occur, and the war would be started. Enough States have left the nation to form, the confederacy </p>
      <p>Ethan runs on stage holding the confederate flag </p>
      <p>Lights dim </p>
      <p>Act 1; Scene 2 </p>
      <p>The lights come on, Ethan comes on stage holding a sign that reads Fort Sumter- April 12, 1861. On the left of the stage stands General Anderson. Union Soldier 1 enters, panicked, stage right</p>
      <p>Union Soldier 1 (Panting): “General Anderson, General Anderson!  Confederates, outside! Hurry!”</p>
      <p>General Anderson: “What?”</p>
      <p>Confederate Soldier 1 and General Beauregard run up from the audience and fire fake guns (with sound) towards General Anderson and Union Soldier 1</p>
      <p>General Beauregard (Very Loud Yell): FIRE</p>
      <p>General Anderson: “Oh my goodness! Take cover soldiers! We’re under attack!</p>
      <p>All of the people on stage freeze. General Beauregard stands pointing towards the stage, Confederate Soldier 1 stands, aiming at the stage. Union Soldier 1 and General Anderson are ducking on stage. Narrator comes out with a chair and takes a seat. </p>
      <p>Narrator: Now this was the first battle of the Civil War. General Beauregard (points towards them) attacked Union Owned Fort Sumter under order of  Confederate President Jefferson Davis. General Anderson (points towards them) was not prepared. Over the span of 2 days their supplies eventually ran out and they surrendered, leaving the fort to confederate control. </p>
      <p>Narrator moves off stage and General Anderson looks up straight and holds up a white flag.</p>
      <p>General Anderson: We surrender!</p>
      <p>General Beauregard: CEASE FIRE</p>
      <p>Confederate Soldier 1 stands up and stops firing. Union Soldier 1 stands up, looks around and wipes their forehead, saying ‘phew’. General Anderson motions Union Soldier 1 forward, towards General Beauregard </p>
      <p>General Anderson: It’s all yours </p>
      <p>General Anderson and Union Soldier walk away ashamed, General Beauregard and Confederate Soldier 1 walk into the building. All stage members freeze. Narrator walks on stage and places down a chair, then sits.</p>
      <p>Narrator: Now, this wasn’t necessarily a battle. It was a surrender because Anderson had 5 times less men than Beauregard. Fort Sumter didn’t even have any casualties, the only death that did happen was a premature explosion in a 21 gun salute, killing one soldier indirectly. The Next battle, however, did have over 4,000 casualties. </p>
      <p>Ethan runs on stage holding a sign that says “The First Battle of Bull Run, July 21, 1861” 
      While he holds the sign, the people on the stage move. General McDowell and Union Soldier 1 stand stage left. General Beauregard and General Johnston stand stage right, facing each other away from the Union Army. General McDowell and Union Soldier 1 face the other 2 Generals and march in place.</p>
      <p>Union Soldier 1: Where are we going now, General McDowell?</p>
      <p>General McDowell: I have orders from Lincoln to head to the capital. </p>
      <p>Union Soldier 1: How close are we, General McDowell?</p>
      <p>General McDowell: We have just reached Bull Run, now, quit asking questions and march, soldier.</p>
      <p>General Beauregard and Johnston turn to look at the union army </p>
      <p>General Beauregard: There they are, General Johnston! FIRE!</p>
      <p>General Johnston turns and gasps at the sight of the union. All four get down on one knee and pretend to fire. All stage members freeze as the Narrator comes onto stage, with a chair. </p>
      <p>Narrator: If you use your imagination and picture 28,000 more Union Soldiers and 32,000 more Confederate Soldiers that is what this battle looked like. It had over 4,000 casualties. And it ended in a confederate victory </p>
      <p>As the last line is said, General Beauregard turns towards the audience as cheers silently.</p>
      <p>Lights dim
      Scene Ends</p>
      <p>Act 2: Scene 1</p>
      <p>Lights come on. Narrator comes on stage.</p>
      <p>Narrator: It is now 1862. This was a very important year, because it was the year the Emancipation Proclamation was made. But, you’re going to have to wait for that. That&#39;s because the first major thing that happened was the Battle of Shiloh.</p>
      <p>Ethan comes on set holding a sign that says, “April 6-7th, 1862, The battle of Shiloh.”  Behind him Union Soldier 1 and Union Soldier 2 come onto the left stage, marching. Confederate Soldier 1 and Confederate Soldier 2 stand stage right </p>
      <p>Union Soldier 1: General Grant is insane for having us come here, just to wait for them to come fight us.</p>
      <p>Union soldier 2: He is still a good general, his methods are just, different…</p>
      <p>Union soldier 1: Let’s hope he stays a good General.”</p>
      <p>Confederate soldiers 1 and 2 walk in as the Union Soldiers stop marching. The Confederates march in place </p>
      <p>Confederate soldier 1: Ready to kill some yankee scum?</p>
      <p>Confederate soldier 2: Sure am, we’ve been hitting them hard recently</p>
      <p>Confederate soldier 1: Sure have </p>
      <p>Both sides begin marching again. They see each other and begin to shoot. Both confederate soldiers let out a scream, and collapsed to the ground. All the people on stage freeze, Narrator walks on stage.</p>
      <p>Narrator: After a day of consistent fighting 62000 soldiers died on both sides. But the union came out with the victory.</p>
      <p>The two Confederates lay dead and the union soldiers walk over and stand over them. All stage members freeze.</p>
      <p>Narrator: This Union victory really made a big change. If the Union had not won the Battle of Shiloh, it would have increased the chance for a confederate victory in the war. It would be 3 Major wins in a row for the confederacy, making the Union lose hope. </p>
      <p>Lights dim </p>
      <p>Act 2: Scene 2 
      Lights come up 
      Narrator walks on stage, with no chair, only standing</p>
      <p>Narrator: The next few battles were some of the deadliest in the history of this war. We will start with the Battle of Antietam. </p>
      <p>Ethan walks on stage holding a sign that reads, “The Battle of Antietam, September 16-18, 1862”
      Robert E. Lee walks on with Confederate Soldier 3</p>
      <p>General Lee: We need to find a way to take their capital. I&#39;m thinking that we take a place In Maryland </p>
      <p>Confederate Soldier 3: But General Lee, we-</p>
      <p>General Lee: We will converge our armies at Antietam Creek, and wait for the Union soldiers to arrive </p>
      <p>Confederate Soldier 3: General Lee, we just-</p>
      <p>General Lee: No, Soldier. I&#39;m sure this is a great plan. </p>
      <p>General Lee and Confederate Soldier 3 March in place. General McClellan and Union Soldier 1 approach from the back of the room. 
      When the 2 Armies see each other, they pretend to fire. They all freeze as the narrator walks on stage.</p>
      <p>Narrator: This was the Bloodiest battle that took place in one day. On September 17th, more than 20,000 casualties occurred. Lee retreated south, and McClellan failed to follow him. This leads Lincoln to trade McClellan with General Burnside. It also leads Lincoln to issue a preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. </p>
      <p>Ethan comes on stage holding a sign that reads “First issue of the emancipation proclamation, September 22, 1862. Lincoln comes on stage behind Ethan, with Audience Members 1 and 2 </p>
      <p>Lincoln: “Members of this fine nation, I am making this speech to tell you that slavery is no longer permitted in the United States.”</p>
      <p>Audience Member 2: Told you. </p>
      <p>All members on stage freeze, narrator walks on stage, with a chair </p>
      <p>Narrator: Now, even if this event seems important, it didn’t really get rid of slavery. It only got rid of it in the states that were rebelling, and wouldn’t listen to him anyway. Even if the proclamation hadn’t been issued, after reconstruction the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments would have been issued for everyone. </p>
      <p>Lights dim </p>
      <p>Act 3: Scene 1
      Lights come on, the narrator walks on stage, again with no chair. </p>
      <p>Narrator: Now, the first thing that did happen in 1863 was the second issue of the Emancipation Proclamation. But, the next battle that was to happen was a major Union victory, and without it the civil war would have lasted many more years. </p>
      <p>Ethan Walks on stage holding a sign that reads, “The Siege of Vicksburg, May 18th, 1863” while General Grant and Lincoln walk on stage </p>
      <p>General Grant: We can end this war, right here, right now.</p>
      <p>Lincoln: How so, General Grant?</p>
      <p>General Grant: If we attack Vicksburg, we could take down Pemberton’s army</p>
      <p>Lincoln: You know what, go ahead</p>
      <p>Everyone on stage Freezes as Narrator walks up with a chair. </p>
      <p>Narrator: Grant didn’t initially want this to be a siege, but because of his failed attacks he had to.</p>
      <p>Grant turns to the audience while no one else moves</p>
      <p>Grant: We must do a siege, none of these attacks are working</p>
      <p>Grant stops moving and faces away from the audience </p>
      <p>Narrator: Now, his siege goes well. Very well. 8 times as many Confederate soldiers died compared to Union soldiers because of sickness. Without this, there would be less cause of a Union victory in the war. Because Grant got Pemberton to surrender, all they needed was Meade to finish taking down Lee’s army, and that’s exactly what he did. </p>
      <p>Everyone walks off stage </p>
      <p>Act 3: Scene 2</p>
      <p>Ethan holds a sign that says “July 1-3, 1863, The Battle of Gettysburg” while General Hooker and Lincoln walk on stage</p>
      <p>General Hooker: Mr.President, I don&#39;t think we need to engage here</p>
      <p>Lincoln: You obviously don’t understand. Just because you lost at Chancellorsville doesn’t mean that you give up now, General Hooker</p>
      <p>General Hooker: But sir, I-</p>
      <p>Lincoln: Your decision to keep arguing with me has made me realize we need a change in command. General Meade?</p>
      <p>General Meade walks in</p>
      <p>General Meade: Sir?</p>
      <p>Lincoln: I need you to confront Lee’s army, in Gettysburg </p>
      <p>General Meade: Yes sir </p>
      <p>The people move around and General Lee, Confederate Soldier 3 are seen stage left, while General Meade and Union Soldier 1 are stage right. </p>
      <p>Union Soldier 1: There!</p>
      <p>Confederate Soldier 3 aims and fires, killing Union Soldier 1 who lets out a scream and collapses. All people on stage freeze, while the narrator walks on stage</p>
      <p>Narrator: Even though it was a Union victory, there were still many Union casualties. Out of 51,000, only 5,000 more people died in the Confederate Army. Lee withdrew his army, making this battle a major turning point in the war. This battle was Lee’s final hope to invade the north. If he had succeeded, then he could have taken the capital and possibly even won the war. This did lead to the Gettysburg Address, surprisingly</p>
      <p>Everyone walks off of stage, Lincoln walks on stage, alone. </p>
      <p>Lincoln: Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.
      He pauses
      Lincoln: This civil war has brought great damage to our country. I am here to honor the soldiers of the union that died. I am also here to dedicate our nation&#39;s new national cemetery, for our fallen soldiers.</p>
      <p>Lights dim. </p>
      <p>Act 4: Scene 1 
      Lights come on and the narrator walks on stage</p>
      <p>Narrator: We are now in 1864. The only major thing to happen involved Union General Sherman, who was labeled as insane </p>
      <p>General Sherman walks on stage with Ethan. Ethan holds up a sign that says “Sherman&#39;s March to the Sea, November 15-December 21, 1864” </p>
      <p>Sherman: I&#39;m going to burn it all! It all needs to go! </p>
      <p>Union Soldier 2: But General, what would that do?</p>
      <p>Sherman: Doesn&#39;t matter! Gather the army, We are going to take down Atlanta! </p>
      <p>Sherman paces the stage with Union Soldier 2, both holding makeshift torches. Narrator walks on stage</p>
      <p>Narrator: Sherman destroyed everything of military value from Atlanta to Savannah, Georgia. The worst part for the south was that Atlanta was a railroad hub and the industrial center of confederacy. When Atlanta fell, many southerners doubted the win in the war. </p>
      <p>Lights dim </p>
      <p>Act 5: Scene 1</p>
      <p>Lights come on, the narrator is found center stage, the same way they were when the play started. </p>
      <p>Narrator: This was the end of the war. Lee attempted to attack Fort Stedman, but was blocked by cavalry. They head down the Appomattox river, ending in Appomattox County. The Union Cavalry blocked  their supply chain. Lee was surrounded by 2 times as many Union Soldiers. </p>
      <p>Ethan comes on and holds a sign that says “The Surrender at Appomattox, April 9, 1865” while General Lee, General Grant, and Confederate Soldier 3  walk on stage. </p>
      <p>Lee: We are trapped in this courthouse. What do we do?</p>
      <p>Confederate Soldier 3: Well General, there isn’t much that we can do. </p>
      <p>General Lee holds out a white flag and cheers can be heard from General Grant</p>
      <p>General Grant: Let us negotiate your surrender.</p>
      <p>The three can be seen talking without speaking as the narrator walks on stage. </p>
      <p>Narrator: This was the end of the battles in the Civil War. This surrender basically ended the Civil War, but one more thing did happen. It was the death of our beloved president. </p>
      <p>Lights dim</p>
      <p>Act 5: Scene 2</p>
      <p>We open in Ford’s theater. Flo, Asa, Lincoln and John Wilkes Booth enter stage. Lincoln is seated off to the left, with Booth standing in the back of the stage. Flo and Asa are center stage. The Narrator walks on, with no other cast moving</p>
      <p>Narrator: This was the place where Lincoln was killed. Ford&#39;s Theater, on April 14, 1865. Lincoln was watching a play entitled, “Our American Cousin.” He was sitting in a special Presidential Booth. The reason Booth found him was because Booth was an actor at the theater, and he had a special key to the booth. It was during Act 3; Scene 2, when something shocked the world. </p>
      <p>Narrator moves off stage with the cast acting again. </p>
      <p>Flo: What do you mean by doing all these dreadful things?</p>
      <p>Asa: Which things.</p>
      <p>Flo: Come here sir. [He does so.]</p>
      <p>Asa: What&#39;s the matter?</p>
      <p>Flo: Do you know this piece of paper? [Showing burnt paper.]</p>
      <p>Asa: Well I think I have seen it before. [Aside.] Its old Mark Trenchard&#39;s will that I left half burned up like a landhead, that I am.</p>
      <p>Flo: And you&#39;re determined to give up this fortune to Mary Meredith?</p>
      <p>Asa: Well, I couldn&#39;t help it if I tried.</p>
      <p>Flo: Oh, don&#39;t say that.</p>
      <p>At this point the dialogue from the play stops and Mary is seated next to Lincoln. 890-They enter conversation. </p>
      <p>Mary: “This is nice! You deserve a break, you&#39;ve worked so hard over the past five years.”</p>
      <p>Lincoln: “Thank you, It will be nice to be president in a non-war United States”</p>
      <p>Mary: Now, let us watch!</p>
      <p>All people on stage stop moving except for Booth, who holds their hand in their pocket and walks up behind Lincoln, then stops moving. </p>
      <p>Narrator: “ It was at this point when the actor, an insane man, John Wilkes Booth broke into the presidential booth, holding a gun.”</p>
      <p>Booth (shouting): “Ever thus to tyrants! And revenge for the south!”</p>
      <p>Booth brings out his gun and pretends to shoot Lincoln, who sits dead slumped over after letting out a scream </p>
      <p>Mary (Shocked and horrified) “Nooooo!”</p>
      <p>Booth jumps to where Asa and Flo were sanding earlier</p>
      <p>Booth (Yelling): SIC SEMPER TYRANNIS!</p>
      <p>Booth limps off of stage. When he is off stage everyone stops moving and narrator walks back on stage</p>
      <p>Narrator: “ Lincoln was pronounced dead the following day, Shooting shock waves through the torn nation. This put an end (mostly) to the violence of the civil war. All that was left was reconstruction of the nation. But that is a story for another day.”</p>
