      <p>I had VERY high expectations for this restaurant. I was told by my entire group of friends and family that this was the best place that they have ever eaten at. They were WRONG. I had ordered the beef tartare and escargot, and when the waiter brought out my plate, he was very angry at me. He yelled over and over saying things like &quot;stop crying&quot; &quot;you do not need to drink anymore orange juice&quot; and &quot;You can&#39;t sit in this 10 seat booth when you&#39;re all by yourself, stop spilling the orange juice everywhere&quot; I was then kicked out of the restaurant, covered head to toe in orange juice, and had too walk the 19 miles back home. Please do NOT go here.</p>
