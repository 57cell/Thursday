      <p>The quesadilla, a popular dish originating from Mexico. It consists of a corn or flour tortilla with cheese and some other type filling, this can be meats, spices, etc. Cheese, a popular dairy product comprised of the fat and proteins from milk; produced in wide ranges of flavors, textures. It can be argued that cheese inherently belongs on a quesadilla as cheese is an integral ingredient. However, those from central Mexico—notably Mexico City—argue that cheese does not inherently belong on quesadillas. Subsequently, in the vernacular of Mexico City, when ordering a quesadilla at any sort of eatery, one has to specify that they want cheese on their quesadilla. This cultural trend can&#39;t be traced back to a single origin. Because of this vernacular tradition, there is a large population in Mexico who believes that cheese does not inherently belong on a quesadilla. However, cheese is inherently a primary ingredient of the quesadilla and is therefore integral to the dish. From the perspective of linguistics, cheese is inherent to the quesadilla. The formal definition for quesadilla-as defined by Merriam-Webster-states the following: “a tortilla filled with cheese and often a savory mixture (as of meat and vegetables), folded, and usually fried.” This details how cheese in generally considered to be inherent to the quesadilla and not merely an optional ingredient. From an etymological standpoint, cheese is inherent to the quesadilla. The prefix quesa- in quesadilla has two definitions from separate origins. The first definition originates from the Latin word “caseum”, it is defined as “cheese.” This justifies the intrinsicness of cheese to the quesadilla. However, the second definition originates from the Aztec language of Nahuatl, “quesaditzin,” which means “folded” or “to fold.” Despite this, cheese is everstill etymologically intrinsic to the quesadilla as, in Spanish, the suffix -ada means “group of” or “full of.” As written by literature &amp; Nahuatl teacher at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, David Bowels:  “When you stick the -ada ending on ‘queso,’ you get ‘quesada,’ which in essence means ‘something full of / made with cheese.’ The -illa ending is a diminutive. So ‘quesadilla’ is literally ‘a little thing made with cheese.’” Therefore, quesadilla could either be defined as “a folded tortilla containing cheese” or “a cheese filled tortilla.” Enduringly, cheese is integral to either one of the definitions. This serves as evidence as to why cheese is inherently a primary ingredient of the quesdallia and is therefore integral to the dish. In conclusion, cheese is integral to the quesadilla, a popular dish originating from Mexico. It consists of a corn or flour tortilla with cheese and some other type filling, this can be meats, spices, etc. However, those from central Mexico—notably Mexico City—argue that cheese does not inherently belong quesadillas. Subsequently, in the vernacular of Mexico City, when ordering a quesadilla at any sort of eatery, one has to specify that they want cheese on their quesadilla. Because of this vernacular tradition, there is a large population in Mexico who believes that cheese does not inherently belong on a quesadilla. However, from an etymological and linguistic perspective, cheese is inherently a primary ingredient of the quesdallia and is therefore integral to the dish.</p>
